In this project, I use a neural network to clone car driving behavior.  It is a supervised regression problem between the car steering angles and the road images in front of a car.  

Those images were taken from three different camera angles (from the center, the left and the right of the car).  

The network is based on [The NVIDIA model](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/), which has been proven to work in this problem domain.
